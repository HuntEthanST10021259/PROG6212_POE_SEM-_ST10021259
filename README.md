Part1 of this project was to create a front end for the claims.
part 2 was to create the functionality and user testing.
i added functionality to create claims and information like extra notes, hours worked, the hourly rate, and supporting documets. 
Once the claim is created it works out the total amount and displays pending and this is shown in the track claims tab which is also a functionality added.
then there verify claim functionality this gives coordinaters/ management to approve or reject claims and this will be updated with in the track claims page automatically

the gui needed improvements as stated by the lectuerr so i decided to make it simpler and neater with a more intutitve flow of the Application.

user testing all tests passed successfully.

there limitations to this project due to the simple nature of it such as every time it is run claims reset to empty due to no actual database.
